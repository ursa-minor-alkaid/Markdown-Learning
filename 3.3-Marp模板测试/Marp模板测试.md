# General Introduction

*   **Interferons (IFNs)** are a group of signaling proteins made and released by **host cells** in response to the presence of several viruses.
*   Interferons are named for their ability to **"interfere"** with viral replication by protecting cells from virus infections.
*   The cells with IFN receptor: Immune cells, Epithelial cells, Endothelial cells

# Clinical Application

When a virus infects a cell, the cell's innate immune sensors detect viral components, such as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA).

This triggers signaling pathways leading to the production and release of interferons by the infected cell.
